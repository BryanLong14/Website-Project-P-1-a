    <h3>11-8-2017 at industry, Denver</h3>

    Chuck Sullivan, Co-Founder, Something Independent (Moderator) <br>
    Jedd Rose, Founder/President, Topo Designs<br>

    <h3>People I Met</h3>
    <p>I arrived at the Meetup early in hopes of chatting with some other eager attendees. There were a couple people there that I spoke with right away.
    I sat down next to Lisa Fox, the owner of a freelance marketing and consulting service. She runs a small company called The Art of Brand Strategy. As we spoke I looked for shared interests - we both just got married - which helped make a potentially awkward conversation easier.
    Lisa has been testing out a couple of different co-wprk spaces around Denver, and is currently working out of WeWork, but is moving to Green Spaces because she likes the more open model better.

    I also spoke with Jenna, a teacher whose boyfriend was presenting. We had a great conversation about teaching and she asked why I changed careers from education to tech.
    It was fun to reflect on the landslide of decisions that led me to become a student at Galvanize, and reminded me that it is a good exercise to remove yourself from the constant moving-and-shaking-mind-meld of learning that we have been partaking in and actually reflect for a few minutes on the transformations that have been taking place over the past month.

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>I learned that there is a significant overlap between the Outdoor Industry and technology. Education and the Outdoor Industry are my two biggest passions and the two fields where I have the most experience.
    I would love to be able to combine my skills and background from one of those two fields with my current push into tech. I could see myself designing websites for an outdoor company or being employed by a smaller company where I worked closer with a product team. All of the presenters mentioned similar themes revolving around the idea that they have found satisfaction in their careers because they were able to meld passion with skill. My most significant takeaway from the meetup was definitely a realization that I should keep sharpening my skills while pursuing my passions, dream and act big, and plan on landing a career in a feild that I am passionate about.</p>
    <h3>Questions I Have</h3>
    <p>The questions that I have are for Adam Hevenor, who works at Pivotal. He was the tech expert on the panel and I am going to reach out to him on LinkedIn. I am going to ask him if he has any advice for a Junior Developer who is passionate about the Outdoor Industry. I am going to ask if he can recommend any blogs, podcasts, or companies to keep an eye on. I am also wondering if he was going to start his career anew, would he try and focus on working at a company that aligned with his passions, or focus on working for a larger company with more job security. It's great to be at a phase in redesigning my career where I can focus simultaneously on the big vision as well as chip away at specific skills that will make me a better developer.</p>
