  <h2>Meetup Information: Project Night - Code for Denver 10-30-2017</h2>
  <article>


    <p>Code for Denver's Mission: Develop tech for and with the communities where they work. <a href="https://www.codefordenver.org/">Code for Denver<a> is an all-volunteer organization. The projects they implement have community partners, giving the projects more likelihood of finding traction.

  <h2>People I Met </h2>
    At the Meetup, Tommasina Miller, a volunteer at Code for Denver helped us with onboarding. Tommasina works at <a href=" https://granicus.com/ ">Granicus<a>. She completed the backend dev bootcamp program at Turing a year ago and has been working at Granicus since graduating. When we chatted she mentioned that she moved to Denver to become a Web Developer. Currently, she is working on an app to help local governments with their process and progress management - sexy stuff! It was really nice being welcomed into Code for Denver by Tommasina. It is clear that Code for Denver is a friendly and incredibly welcoming place that invites people of all technical levels and backgrounds.

    I also met and sat next to Fred, who is currently taking the part-time Fullstack Dev Bootcamp at DU. He mentioned that he and his girlfriend moved up from Florida a year ago and that he is working full time while doing the bootcamp. To be honest it made me glad that I am at a spot where I can fully devote my life to learning the tools and skills of Web Development as opposed to part-timing it.

    Other people I spoke with included Willy, who was working as the Facilitator for the event and Hugh, who is managing the Social Media for Code for Denver.

    Here's an image of the Meetup from their website.

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    I learned that Code for Denver is an incredibly interesting way to combine people's coding skills with the needs of groups and small organizations in Denver. I think it could be an excellent networking resource as well as a way to put my junior dev chops to use. It could also be a great place to find a mentor.

    At the Meetup I also learned about a project management tool that Code for Denver uses called <a href="https://waffle.io/codefordenver/projects">Waffle IO</a>. It seems like a really clear way to organize projects that have multiple iterations and is an excellent way to visually display the projects that groups of people are collaborating on. Waffle also links in seamlessly with GitHub, which is another plus.

    <h2>Questions I Have</h2>
    While I was at the Meetup, I was wondering if this would be a good resource to combine a project I would like to bring to creation with a community group. Specifically, I wonder if we could find a community partner that I could use to make my Q4 project more ambitious and relevant. One example of what this may look like in use is <a href=" http://www.freshfoodconnect.org/">Fresh Food Connect</a>, an idea that was incubated via Code for Denver and then took solid root when Denver Urban Gardens teamed up with them. A scalable project such as this may be a bit ambitious for a Galvanize Q4 project, but it is a methodology of thinking that interests me.

    Another question that I have is are my current technical talents useful for a group like Code For Denver? I t might be the case that my project management skills could be helpful now and that as I improve my technical skills I could find a project to work on. </p>
