<h3>People I Met</h3>
Ross, James, and I biked to the meetup early. When we got to Code Talent, there weren't many people there and I talked for a while with Matt Webb, the organizer. He works for Blinker - an app used to buy and sell cars. In our conversation, I found out that Blinker also does car refinancing and that Blinker is expanding their operation to Texas and California. Matt was super friendly and we chatted a bit about the history of the Denver Script Meetup.

I also spoke to Guillermo Moratorio for a bit before his Lightning Talk. He works at Volte. He spoke about the importance of going to Meetups, even if you don't totally understand the content presented. We bantered a bit about Galvanize and what life was like as a Galvanize grad. It was excited to hear people speak positively about the program.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
One thing I learned is how Meetups are organized and paid for. When I was speaking with Matt I found out that for Denver Script, different companies sponsor the space, the beer, and the food. I am not sure if this formatting is the same for other Meetups, but it seemed like good advertising for the organizations who were sponsoring the event and obviously it was a win for those attending. Specifically, Andy and Corrine, whose company sponsored the pizza had a job opening.

In short, I learned that Meetups are a great place to get yourself into the Dev community, make connections with people, and network.

<h3> JS and CSS Variables - Mike Fraizer</h3>

Mike showed us how you can use custom variables in CSS. To be honest the talk was over my head as I don't have an advanced understanding of CSS. One thing that I took away from this session was that you can use embedded CSS Variables as opposed to doing the work in a preprocessor.

<h3>Chrome DevTools 201 - Guillermo Moratorio</h3>
Guillermo took us through some advanced Chrome Dev Tools including debugging JavaScript. At one point he had to debug a line of his code that wasn't working. I learned that all developers (even more senior developers) are constantly problem solving, learning new tricks, and becoming more efficient in their workflow.

## Questions I Have
One question I have is I wonder how I can expand my knowledge and use of Chrome Dev Tools.

A second question I have is I wonder which preprocessing tool SASS, Stylus or Less, would best fit my style.
