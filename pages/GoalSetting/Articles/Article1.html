  <h2>Bryan's Smart Goal #1 on 10-20-17:</h2>
<P>
   By 2:00 today I am going to add JQuery actions to my personal site.
  I have no experience with JQuery, and as a specific goal, I would like to add a clickable button that allows me to transfer from one page to another. Right now I am transfering between pages as a simple link.

  Play:
   In order to learn about JQuery, I ended up using some online resources and worked with Mike as an in-person resource. One successful action that I count as a win was that I used w3school to find code snippets for
  JQuery www.w3schools.com/

  I used these snippets to understand some of the base building blocks for JQuery and to begin learning the syntax to implement simple actions. After playing with the technology, I was about to add a couple of clickable buttons that showed and hid a photo of my wife and me on our honeymoon. One difficult aspect was setting the initial display state of the photo as False so it would not display when the page is loaded until the button was clicked.

  Reflection:
  I did partially meet the goal. After engaging in the Play phase, I got distracted by the elements of J Query and ended up adding clickable button as opposed to learning and using the technology to button-click-transfer between pages. One reason why I count this as a success is that, although I didn't stick to my initial goal, I realized that the technology would be more powerful to show another aspect of my life - namely my relationship with my wife - as opposed to simply clicking between pages. Another action that was successful was asking Mike for help. He has significantly more coding experience, including knowledge of JQuery, so relying on him was beneficial when I got stuck. This is a win because it allowed me to move on from what was a simple mistake that I was not catching by myself to a place where I could get the website working.

  Evidence:

  One thing I need to work on is to watch more tutorials on JQuery in order to actually understand how it works. I consider this a 'not win' because I don't understand the real syntax behind the technology, I simply got something working. I would like to be able to replicate the tech in the future without needed to ask others for help. Tomorrow (or next time I work on JQuery) I will read more of the documentation or watch some of the fundamental tutorials for the technology before trying to simply implement a feature. </P>
