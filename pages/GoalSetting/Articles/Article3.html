  <h1>Goal Setting</h1>
  <h2>Article 3 - Building Basic Websites</h2>

  <article>
      <h2>10-30-17 - Goal:</h2> By 2:00 PM today, I am going to complete <a href="https://github.com/BryanLong14/build-basic-websites/tree/master/drills/version-2">Building Basic Websites Version 2</a>. I am going to make the website for a faux-real company, my photography business. When I did the version 1 of "Building Basic Websites" drill, I made the landing page as an empty template, so I want to fill this version with content to get practice with both styles.

  <h2>Reflection:</h2>
  I was able to meet my time goal, finishing the Version 2 of the drill by 2:00 PM. That said, I ended up changing the content of the fill on the page because of image restrictions. I did find a site that would allow me to upload images and then take representational portions of those images to use as placeholder images. This is something I would love to do when I have some spare time so that I could create sites with placeholder images that are from my photography bank. I feel like this would also be interesting to potential employers, and would improve my work repo. That said, for this assignment, I decided to spend time focusing on fulfilling the components of the rubric as opposed to focusing on image quality.

  Here is what the finished version 2 blog page looks like:

  One successful action that I undertook in order to complete part of my goal included first focusing on the initial "boxes" of content where I was going to begin implementing my blog design. This is something I want to repeat in the future as it gave me a really solid visualization when I was working in Flexbox.

  Another successful action that I took was working through the HTML portion of the Blog site, then taking a break which included brief exercise (walking up and down the stairs) before coming back with a fresh slate in order to work on the CSS implementation.

  What didn't go well? I am wondering about "best practices" for spacing (how to best use padding, margins, line breaks, etc). Obviously, this depends on the circumstance the developer is trying to implement, but I would myself initially using line breaks to move the header down on the blog page I was making. It made my HTML code look a little "bloated". I spoke with Marlena about this question and we decided to go with a magin:top in the CSS, which would give me more functionality later and keep the HTML code cleaner. The action of "using code bloat" didn't allow me to meet one of my bigger goals of writing efficient, clean code. Hopefully, with more knowledge, I will be able to write code quicker, with more readability, and more efficiently.
