  <h1>Goal Setting Article 2</h1>
  <h2>Bryan's Smart Goal #2</h2>
  <h2>10-23-17</h2>
<p>By the end of the day today I am going to join 10 meetup groups and sign up for at least 1 meetup that I will commit to going to next week.

Were the goals met? Yes or no. What went well? The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.' What didn't go well? The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met. What will you do differently tomorrow?

Reflection: I did meet the goal. I ended signing up for the following meetup: Monthly Denver Script Meetup Tuesday, October 24, 2017, 6:00 PM

I am excited to attend this meetup for various reasons. I am looking forward to getting a better sense of the Dev Community in Denver, hearing working professionals speak about topics of their interest, and learning from their lightning talks. Two of the lightning talks that are going to be given include: JS and CSS Variables Chrome DevTools. These are topics I would like to learn more about and are areas of current learning for me.

One positive action I took that led to success was coordinating my calendar for next week with my wife's to make sure I was going to the meetup on a night when she is working. Another successful action was Slacking out the invite for the Meetup to their G70 Cohort. These actions were a win because inviting other classmates to join will give me an accountability partner and allow us to bounce ideas off each other. This is important because it will help develop relationships in the class that could prove to be the building blocks of future professional relationships. Furthermore, we will be able to problem solve together based on concepts learned during the Lightning Talks.</p>
