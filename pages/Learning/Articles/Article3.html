  <h3>Set the Stage</h3>
  <article>
    <p>When preparing to learn a new, complicated skill, it is critical to "Set The Stage". Setting the Stage means preparing one's physical and mental workspace in order to be fully committed to completing the task at hand. For today, that meant mentally disregarding my "to-do list" outside of class and any lingering thoughts about things that did and did not go well this past weekend so that I could focus my mental clarity on learning new material. With regards to my physical workspace, it was important to get my computer ready. In today's lesson, that meant closing out unnecessary applications and extra tabs that don't specifically dovetail with the task at hand. Finally, I found a quiet space on the third floor to work without interruption. See the video for a brief overview of how I did this.</p>

    <p>Today I am going to focus the next two hours of my learning on the following core components of JavaScript:
    <ul>
    <li>Arrays</li>
    <li>Variables</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>Loops</li>
    </ul>

    <p>t's worth mentioning that the reason I am choosing to focus my learning on this topic is because understanding the key functionality of JavaScript is instrumental in becoming a web developer, computer programmer, or web designer.... er wait, what's the difference between those again?

    I Set the Stage and chose my work goal for the purpose of completing a drill in JavaScript:  solving a cash register problem using basic programming skills. I have a dedicated note-taking space where I am going to record my thoughts on the material and hope to begin and complete at least one JavaScript drill by the end of the day today.
</p>
    <h2>Play and Reflection</h2>
    <p>The next phase of my work:
    <ol>
    <li>Rereading past notes on JavaScript</li>
    <li>Studying new material through Galvanize's Learn depository</li>
    <li>Looking for outside resources if necessary</li>
    <li>Diving into the drill</li>
    </ol></p>

  <p>  First I reread notes that I have previously taken regarding JavaScript. These are from a few sources, the most useful of which was JavaScript for Kids. This helped me brush up on the terminology and syntax of what I was learning. Then I played around with the materials in Galvanize's Learn Depository. This included reading existing code and practicing writing code snippets in order to internalize JavaScript functionality. Then I dove into the drill.  I found that trying to write a solution to the drill without having experience nesting for loops, combining conditional statements, and calling methods withing JavaScript functions was difficult, and realized that I hadn't fully understood the different terms. I finished the day frustrated that I hadn't internalized the material.

    Although Setting the Stage did help optimize my learning, in reflection I realized that I have to scale my objectives appropriately before making my daily goals and setting my objectives.

    From here, tomorrow I know I need to inspect some of the written code for the practice and then - from there - extract the ideas and principles so that I can solve the drill. This is my plan going forward and continuing my learning in JavaScript.
