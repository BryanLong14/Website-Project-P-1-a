  <h3>Set the Stage</h3>
  <article>
    <p>In diving into Learning to Learn, I decided to revisit the material presented to us, and began by revisiting the slide deck.
      The first step is to clear the stage. Before getting into work, I had multiple windows open, had my "To Do list" open, my Spotify,
      lots of distracting tabs,
      and several other programs. See the before screenshot: <br>

    <p>After setting the stage, I was able to focus on the slidedeck and notes exclusively. I closed out distracting tabs and programs and set my
      Spofity to a good background playlist. The stage was set!: </p><br>

    <h3>Goal for Play Time</h3>
    <p>Bryan's Smart Goal #2 on 10-20-17: By 2:00 today I am going to write a blogpost about J Query,
      which I am going to dabble in today. I have no experience with J Query, and as a specific goal,
      I would like to add a clickable button to my personal site that allows me to transfer from one page to another. Right now I have it set up as a link. </p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>After visiitng a couple of w3School TryIt Fiddles, I was able to see some patterns in the J
      Query code and then use some of the code to add a couple of buttons into my personal website.
      The example I used as a master was: https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_hide_show

    Setting the Stage helped me because it allowed me to work more effectively. Having music on that doesn't
    distract signlas others that I am working, and keeps my mind from wandering. Closing out unnecessary tabs helped me by reducing clutter on my screen.

    The script I ended up adding to my personal site hides and then shows a photo of my wife and
    me on a recent trip that we took. On image click, the photo appears and disappears</p>
