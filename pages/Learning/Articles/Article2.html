  <h3>Set the Stage</h3>
  <article>
    <p>In order to set the stage, this morning I out on a good playlist on Spotify, put in my headphones, and closed extraneous windows and tabs. I wanted to keep my Slack channel open in case there are any 1-one-1 meetings happening today.
    See the image of my desktop below: <br>

    <p>My goal for the day is to complete the first TS-1 objective by lunch - in an hour and a half. I would like to do this because I need to learn about CSS and Layout.

    I am going to work through the following lessons:
<article>  <ol>
     <li> <a href ="https://learn.galvanize.com/content/gSchool/html-css-curriculum/master/HTML/README.md">Intro to HTML</a>  </li>
     <li><a href ="https://learn.galvanize.com/content/gSchool/html-css-curriculum/master/HTML/Semantic.md">Semantic HTML</a></li>
     <li><a href ="https://learn.galvanize.com/content/gSchool/html-css-curriculum/master/CSS/README.md">CSS</a></li>
  </ol></article><br>


    <p>  I feel like I have a solid understanding of HTML including semantic tags, so my main focus is going to be working through the Flexbot lesson.  Then I am going to complete the drill located here: https://github.com/BryanLong14/build-basic-websites</p>
     <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>After spending a couple of hours working through the lessons, I realized that I did not have enough time to start the buld-basic-websites work before lunch. I did learn a lot about furthering HTML layout and combining them with CSS properties. I am still a little unclear about targeting CSS Selector Types:

    Here are some notes:
    Element (select by element name: body, h1, div, etc.)
    Class (uses a dot . )
    ID (uses a hashtag # )
    Tips
    Just use a space if you want to select all elements within a nested element
    Use * to select everything within an element
    Use + to select siblings (elements that are on the same level)
    Use > to select a child of another element

    In reflection, I am gettng used to using CSS Selectors more. I found the CSS Diner to be especially helpful during the Play portion of my Layout Learning: http://flukeout.github.io/#

    Setting the Stage helped me because it allowed me to work more effectively. Having music on that doesn't distract signlas others that I am working, and keeps my mind from wandering. Closing out unnecessary tabs helped me by reducing clutter on my screen. That said, next time when I need to set the stage I need to have a deeper understanding of exactly what the work is that I am getting into. Looking at the bigger picture, I did not meet my entire goal. I recognize that it is difficult to set a time specific goal without knowing how much content was in the lessons and drills. My prep for setting the stage did work well. I was focused during my work. Tomorrow I will need to really read through the drill and the practice examples before creating a goal, so I have an idea how long the Play section will realistically take. Tomorrow I will build off the work I did today by continuing to learn about Floats and Flexbox.</p>
